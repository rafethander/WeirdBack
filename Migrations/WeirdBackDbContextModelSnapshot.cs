                            Content = "AT ONE POINT John Mills and his wife, Erica, were members at three different gyms, where John could lift weights and Erica could take indoor cycling classes. Still, something about the ads he kept seeing for Peloton intrigued John, a 50-year-old software architect in Bloomfield, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIn October 2016, he took the plunge and bought Erica a Peloton bike. They converted a kids’ playroom–their children are now grown—into a makeshift home gym. Mills quickly figured out how to cast Peloton classes from the bike’s tablet to the playroom’s giant projector screen, using a native Android streaming option. When Peloton started selling an expensive treadmill in 2018, the Mills bought one of those too. And in late 2019, they splurged on a second bike.\r\n\r\nSo when Covid-19 forced millions of people into shutdown in early March, the Mills were well ahead of the home gym trend. They canceled their gym memberships. The only logical thing to do was to keep building, Mills figured. He started looking into new flooring for the playroom, purchased weights, and preordered a $4,295 Yves Behar-designed fitness mirror and resistance system called Forme Life. It’s these kinds of all-in-one, internet-connected fitness products that people chat about in Mills’ Facebook group, Run, Lift & Live, which has more than 4,000 members.\r\n\r\n“Back in March or April, folks would either say, ‘I’m never ever going back to a gym,’ or they’d say ‘I get that I have to work out at home for now, but I like the social aspect of the gym and want to go back,’” Mills tells me. “Now in the group, it’s ‘What’s the Tempo device like? How about Tonal? When will Carbon ship?’ No one is talking about the gym anymore.”\r\n\r\nA New Spin\r\nThat sentiment is exactly what Peloton is hoping to capitalize on with its latest offerings. The seven-year-old fitness tech company, which has attracted more than a million paying subscribers with its blend of live-streamed and on-demand classes, was already a pandemic success story. Today it’s officially revealing its long-rumored new products: a new indoor cycling bike; a less expensive version of its old bike; a cheaper treadmill; a new series of bootcamp classes; and some software updates, including integration with Apple’s GymKit. (Much of this was previously reported by Bloomberg late last week.)\r\n\r\n“You want to be able to excite people to work out, and we saw that formula come to life with the first Peloton Bike and Tread,” says Tom Cortese, Peloton’s chief operating officer and a cofounder of the New York City-based company. “So the idea that we could make this more accessible to more folks and more homes in more markets, just felt like, Yes. We’ve got a runner here. Let’s do that next step and make it more compact and at a lower price point.”\r\n\r\nThere are still elements of in-person exercise that can’t be replaced by AI mirrors, VR workouts, and sensor-packed dumbbells.\r\n\r\nThe new Peloton indoor cycling bike, called Bike+, has a 23.8-inch swivel touchscreen, compared to the 22-inch touchscreen that stays fixed in position on the first bike. That means riders will be able to rotate the screen and transition more easily to other kinds of workout classes, like the “Bike Bootcamp” classes Peloton will soon roll out. The new bike also has a four-speaker sound system—an improvement over the first bike, which blares sound outward from the back of the tablet rather than towards the rider. And riders can opt to have their resistance auto-adjusted throughout a workout, rather than manually turning the resistance knob.\r\n\r\nThe new Bike+ ships this month and costs $2,495, while the “old” Bike is getting a price drop, from $2,245 to $1,895. (To appease customers who may have just spent $2,245 on the first bike, Peloton will issue a credit for the difference if their purchase was made within the last 30 days.)\r\nPeloton is also expanding its treadmill lineup, although to start that will only include a name change. The $4,295 Peloton Tread is now being called the Tread+; otherwise, it’s the same hefty slat-belt treadmill and 32-inch touchscreen as before. The new, lower-priced Tread won’t ship until early 2021. That one will cost $2,495 and will ave a traditional treadmill belt and smaller display.\r\n\r\nThe subscription cost of Peloton, where the company typically sees a healthy gross margin, is staying the same: $39 per month for “all access” to Bike and Tread content and app-based workouts, and $13 for classes streamed via mobile apps only. It’s arguably this subscription content that’s more important than any hardware updates to an exercise bike or treadmill, any swivel screen or slat-belt. It’s the Peloton instructors—their personalities, catchphrases, and playlists—that tend to win people over.\r\n\r\n“It’s about incentives,” Peloton’s Cortese says. “I like to say that gyms are the worst in terms of having their incentives aligned to the consumer. They want you to show up in January, pay for the membership, and then never go, right? Our incentives are aligned to our members. We employ thousands of people whose jobs it is, every single day, to find out how we can cause you to want to work out more.”\r\n\r\nHome Gym Challenges\r\nPeloton fanatics—and company executives—might be thrilled by the idea of a Pelo-filled future, one where the home gym effectively replaces the big-box spaces we used to drive to for the chance to sweat and grunt in front of strangers. But, while our post-Covid future is still unclear, some say the death of gyms may be greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nFor one, home gyms require both a certain amount of space and disposable income. And some makers of home fitness products are struggling to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\nThe high costs could be justified over time. Peloton, for example, likes to point out that up to five household members can use the same machine under the same $39 per month subscription cost. And one set of weights could serve the entire family. But space could still be a barrier for some people, along with installation needs. A product like Tonal, a $2,995 all-in-one training display with an electromagnetic resistance engine, needs to be bracketed to a suitable wall; whereas something like the $1,495 Mirror home gym system can be leaned against a wall. (In another sign that the home fitness space has been heating up, Mirror was recently acquired by Lululemon for $500 million.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of free weights for your home gym: Good luck finding them. The overwhelming majority of free weights sold in the US are made in China, and disruptions to the supply chain early on in the pandemic have created a serious backlog for dumbbells, just as demand has soared.\r\n\r\nStephen Owusu, the founder and chief executive of JaxJox, says business has been booming since March. JaxJox sells a nifty, Wi-Fi-connected kettlebell system for $199, and just last week announced plans to ship a modular, interactive display with weights for $2,199. But the waitlist for JaxJox kettlebells is currently 3,000 customers deep.\r\n\r\n“If you take our situation, there’s no way we could have forecasted a 347 percent increase in sales [earlier this year],” Owusu says. “You do your best. You say, ‘We’ll place an order for X amount.’ And when the products come in, they all go. I think the whole market has experienced this.”\r\n\r\nCarbon, an all-in-one fitness system that’s been touted as the first “AI-powered” fitness mirror, won’t ship until sometime in 2021, according to its Indiegogo fundraising page. John Mills says that he hasn’t received an update about Forme Life, the $4,295 home workout system he preordered this spring. In July he received a set of Forme Life towels as a thank-you for preordering, but his notes to the company have gone unanswered. (The company’s website says delivery is expected sometime this fall.) And the wait time for Peloton bikes is something its community members complain about regularly on the company’s official Facebook page.\r\nRight now, the average wait time for a Peloton is around 45 days, Cortese says, though that varies based on zip code. One analyst has warned that one of the biggest challenges for the company—which reports its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on September 10—is keeping up with demand.\r\n\r\nSplit Times\r\nJaxJox’s Owusu says he believes the future of fitness looks more like a hybrid model, where people work out at home more frequently than they did before, but eventually return to the gym. “Rather than the home being a supplement to their gyms, the gyms will become a supplement to what they do at home,” he says.\r\n\r\nThat’s why JaxJox is building the upcoming JaxJox interactive system to be portable and content-agnostic, Owusu says. The display part of the system will work just like a TV, one that can serve as the entertainment hub in your living room. And Owusu says the company wants to partner with boutique fitness franchise OrangeTheory, with an eye towards the future. Some days people might want an in-person workout in an OrangeTheory studio, and other days they might want to stay home.\r\n\r\nOwusu isn’t alone in that thought. Around the US, gyms are slowly reopening, though with lots of social distancing and sanitizing, and with little available data on the potential risk of infection. Also, some gym members are missing the sense of community that they feel in fitness centers.\r\n\r\nEven proponents of online fitness classes say there’s a social element that’s lacking. Nt Etuk is one of those people. The founder and chief executive of FitGrid, which sells customer management software to boutique fitness studios, Etuk says he thinks “the fitness industry has moved forward five years in the space of four months” in terms of how it has embraced technology. Earlier this year FitGrid surveyed around 2,000 fitness studios; 95 percent of them said they would offer both digital and in-studio classes once they’re fully reopened. Yoga and high-intensity interval classes classes, in particular, have been popular in online formats.\r\n\r\n“But the other side is that energy you get from being around people,” Etuk says. “And fitness studios are one of those spaces where people may come back to more of those social instincts, that ambient awareness that there are other people around you doing the same stuff.” In other words, the pandemic may have accelerated the digital fitness space, but there are still elements of in-person exercise that can’t be replaced by AI mirrors, VR workouts, and sensor-packed dumbbells.\r\n\r\nFor someone like John Mills, that social element still doesn't feel worth the risk. He’s content to work out at home, and he posts to his Facebook group multiple times a day about all of the developments in the digital fitness world and how it might affect Peloton, which he holds stock in.\r\n\r\n“If I did go back to a gym, it would likely be after the creation of a vaccine, and after that vaccine had been proven, validated, and the country and society in general would be comfortable that this is not a risk,” Mills says. “And my mind keeps telling me that’s three, four, five years out.”",

                            Content = "IN HIS NEW book out today, former FBI agent Peter Strzok eschewed the traditional complimentary blurbs from famous friends for a different tack. The back cover of Compromised: Counterintelligence and the Threat of Donald J. Trump relies instead on some very famous criticism: Trump calling Strzok a “fraud.”\r\n\r\nThat approach seems fitting, since the reason Strzok wrote a book at all is that he was caught up in a unique 21st-century scandal, a surreal intersection of texts, tweets, Donald Trump, and Russia. Strzok became the most famous FBI agent in the world after his private, candid political comments and fears about Donald Trump were spread—cynically and wrongly—by Rod Rosenstein’s Justice Department as part of the inspector general’s review of the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Investigators also uncovered and publicized Strzok’s affair with fellow FBI lawyer Lisa Page.\r\n\r\n“Fraud” is hardly even the worst thing Trump has called the former agent; Strzok’s partial list of presidential insults on page 303 fills nearly half the page: “incompetent,” “corrupt,\" “horrible,” “hate-filled” “totally biased,” “low,” “terrible,” “disgusting,” “stupid” “bad person,” “sick sick” person,” “con artist,” “evil person,” and much more.\r\n\r\nMost of all, though, Trump accused Strzok of “treason,” of being the central figure in a Deep State plot to block and negate his presidential victory, of leading a “coup.” The irony isn’t lost on Strzok, who in 2016 found himself both leading the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and simultaneously racing to uncover the truth about the Russian links to the Trump campaign.\r\n\r\nIndeed, part of what makes Strzok such an odd villain for the Trump age is that—apart from some inopportune intimate text messages—all evidence seems to show that Strzok approached the Trump investigation with integrity and independence. Through a fall where he and other senior FBI leaders possessed perhaps the most damaging secret ever on a presidential candidate, none of them uttered the slightest public hint.\r\n\r\n“Everything the FBI did that fall hurt Hillary and helped Trump. All this talk about a coup—there are things right now that I and others know from 2016 that would still damage his candidacy today,” Strzok told me in a phone interview this week. “We’re all walking around and no one’s said a word. If this is a coup it’s incompetent.”\r\n\r\nThat practiced silence—the code of intelligence professionals—showcases the other irony of his new book and publicity tour: Until the moment his text messages became stunningly public, Strzok as a counterintelligence agent had tried hard to stay out of the public eye. He relates the story of how 19 years ago, as a relatively junior agent in Boston on September 11, 2001, he and his partner located the car in the Logan Airport parking garage left behind by the hijackers, and then how, as news crews descended on the scene, he had to step behind a concrete pillar to hide his face. Even then, his day job was tracking Russian spies, surveilling and watching two of what would later be exposed as “the Illegals,” the deep-cover Russian intelligence officers living ordinary lives in the United States that would inspire the hit FX TV show, The Americans.\r\n\r\nThe finding of those texts led to a rapid downfall: Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, reassigned from counterintelligence to human resources, roasted by Capitol Hill Republicans, villainized by the right-wing media, names as the supposed linchpin of the Deep State collusion plot by the president, and ultimately fired by the bureau. (Strzok became such an infamous figure on the right that he made the hit list of MAGA bomber Cesar Sayoc, a story he relates in the book.)\r\nMeanwhile, most Americans have never known anything more in-depth about Strzok than those texts. After spending two years as a punch line and exclamation point, Strzok appears in Compromised for the first time as a fully formed human being.\r\n\r\nI’ve spent a dozen years covering the FBI, written multiple books about the bureau and dozens of magazine articles, interviewed hundreds of its employees—from evidence technicians and analysts to six of its eight directors—and probably spoken to FBI personnel more days than not since 2008. And part of what’s so surprising about Strzok’s unique and engaging book—part memoir, part lesson in intelligence tradecraft, and part cri de couer—is just how utterly typical an FBI agent he appears to be.\r\n\r\nFar from a conniving villain or Deep State plant, Strzok—who by the summer of 2018 was the deputy assistant director of the bureau’s counterintelligence division, the number two job in one of the FBI’s most important missions—was widely regarded in the bureau as one of the most promising counterintelligence agents of his generation. He comes across in the book as driven, aggressive, respectful, patriotic, and deeply bound to the principles and procedures of the FBI. He certainly is no Hillary Clinton superfan, as he finds himself repeatedly stymied by her team’s stonewalling of the email investigation. (By way of disclosure, Strzok and I have previously only met once in passing, though we do share the same literary agent.)\r\n\r\nStrzok joined the bureau as a counterterrorism analyst, part of its post-Oklahoma City bombing expansion, and spent most of the 2000s as an agent working some of the most important national security cases. He uses that background in the book to reframe America’s understanding of what transpired regarding the FBI, the Trump campaign, and Mueller’s investigation. As he says, the Trump-Russia scandal was about Russia—not Trump. It was a counterintelligence operation, not a criminal one.\r\n\r\nIt started with valid intelligence leads about persons associated with the Trump campaign. “We would've investigated the same if Russia had had this response from the Sanders campaign, Clinton’s campaign, or any other candidate,” he said in our telephone interview.\r\n\r\n\"Everything the FBI did that fall hurt Hillary and helped Trump.\"\r\n\r\nFORMER FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK\r\n\r\nTo outsiders, the distinction between a counterintelligence and a criminal case may not seem important. To the bureau, they’re drastically different. Counterintelligence is less science, more art, Strzok’s book argues, a complex geopolitical dance to figure out what matters to adversaries, and observe, disrupt, deflect, or intercept that behavior as deemed necessary. Such cases rarely spill over into criminal courts. Most counterintelligence work remains invisible to the public—and the very best of it, like the decade of surveillance against the Illegals, remains invisible to the adversaries too.\r\n\r\nThe investigation that ultimately grew to focus on four figures of Trump world—Carter Page, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Mike Flynn—certainly didn’t begin with the idea of targeting Donald Trump himself.\r\n\r\n“Simply put, we weren’t targeting anyone,” Strzok writes. “Rather, we were doing the work of FBI counterintelligence agents: investigating a credible allegation of foreign intelligence activity to see where it led. Our goal was to get to the root of what Russia had done, what it was doing, and its impact on national security. It started with Russia, and it was always about Russia.”\r\n\r\nHis book is the first real window into the confusion of the investigative team as they struggled to make sense of a campaign that, if not working directly with Russia, certainly encouraged Russian help, and subsequently an administration that didn’t exactly seem to go out of its way to push back on Russia.\r\n\r\n“The Trump administration's actions vis-a-vis Russia were highly suspicious, highly consistent, and highly advantageous to America's historic adversary without clearly benefiting, and at times even disadvantaging, our own security and stability,” Strzok writes, thinking back on the political landscape in 2017. He’s quick to point out, too, that the Trump administration’s inexplicable friendliness to Russia continues to the present day, including a half-hearted-at-best condemnation of the poisoning of Putin critic Alexi Navalny.\r\nEven as the Trump campaign scandal morphed from background noise in Washington to all-consuming media and congressional frenzy, it remained to the FBI a story fundamentally about Russia and Vladimir Putin. As Strzok writes, “Russia has been the alpha and omega of US counterintelligence throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.” (Or, as he described Russia more bluntly in one of his private text messages to Page: “F*cking conniving cheating savages. At statecraft, athletics, you name it. I’m glad I’m on Team USA.”)\r\n\r\nStrzok is a uniquely strong voice against authoritarianism and threats to democracy in part because he’s seen what happens when governments fail or fall. He grew up overseas, following the career of his father, an international development adviser, and experienced four revolutions on three continents before he left for college, from Iran to Burkina Faso to Haiti. As he writes in the book, “I never thought I would have occasion to revisit those lessons at home, in the United States. And I never expected to see the grotesque traits of dictators in Haiti or Iran reflected in my own commander-in-chief.”\r\n\r\nNow, as Strzok sees it, the danger of Trump’s presidency is how Trump so willingly seems to advance Russia’s interests. Trump is withdrawing the United States abroad and causing longtime friends to reconsider their own security alliances, even as his policies and rhetoric widen divisions at home. “If the US is not involved on the world stage, that’s an opening for Russia,” Strzok says. “Russia today is doing a phenomenal job driving their agenda with a weak hand. They’re not China—they don’t have a huge economy and industry-leading growth sectors. What’s incredible is that Putin, as he’s built a kleptocratic state and siphoned off the wealth of his nation, he’s still been able to parlay that into a meaningful role on the world stage.”\r\n\r\nThe threat from Russia has not diminished since 2016, Strzok says. In many ways, Trump’s actions at home and abroad have provided even more openings for the type of social media flame-fanning that the Internet Research Agency did to benefit Trump in 2016.\r\n\r\n“They can see that we are at war with ourselves,” Strzok told me. “They see very well that they can exacerbate those tensions—tensions that already are to the point of killings, riots, and protests. The more we’re fighting ourselves, the less we’re focused overseas, the more they’re creating an opening for themselves.”\r\n\r\nAs he argues in the book and emphasized in our interview, the US government missed the warning signs of how social media was going to change the political information environment. While Russia had for decades tried and perfected disinformation and misinformation campaigns, the internet made possible much more powerful efforts than the faked State Department cables or rumors about a US senator’s sexuality that Russia had previously experimented with.\r\n\r\n“They were always really good with propaganda and disinformation, but it's this boutique-type intel activity. It was a lot of effort for not much reward,” Strzok says. “My failure, the FBI's failure, the whole US government’s failure is we didn't understand how social media was a game changer for this disinformation work. We saw it on the counterterrorism side, with ISIS.0 We saw Russia using it in the near-abroad, like Ukraine. But none of us took the next step and asked, ‘Are we vulnerable?’ We were caught flat-footed.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, he warns, the US still hasn’t made enough progress online to confront these challenges. “We haven’t societally fixed any of this. We haven’t even figured out whether this is an industry matter or a government one,” he says. “The press hasn’t solved any of this. If the GRU dumped the Biden campaign's binder of opposition research on Kamala Harris right now, every news organization and publishing house would race to publish it. I think if you reset the players and the facts of 2016, I’m willing to bet it plays out exactly the same way.”\r\nHis book’s title, Compromised, comes from the hunt to determine whether Trump or the campaign were indeed acting at the behest of Russian interests, wittingly or not. But his larger point is that Trump himself has fundamentally compromised and corrupted his office. Americans never had to worry whether previous presidents were working on behalf of US interests. With Trump, they do.\r\n\r\nMost of all, though, Strzok argues in the book, too few Americans still see the 2016 Trump campaign scandal and the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the 2019 impeachment hearings as separate events, whereas a clear line joins them: Russia and its regional interests. “The only real difference is that in 2019, the compromised individual was not a long-shot presidential candidate but rather the chief executive of the United States, a man who could wield the full power of his office for personal gain—and whose malfeasance also implicated, and compromised, a much larger organization than a presidential campaign,” Strzok writes.\r\n\r\nStrzok says he continues to be puzzled by the Trump administration’s unwillingness to strongly confront Putin’s behavior on the world stage. “It happens in some really weird ways—the odd decision to pull troops out of Germany, his bizarre comments about Montenegro, his refusal to engage in sanctions-like behavior with Russia over the Skripal poisoning or Navalny,” he explains.\r\n\r\nIt seems unlikely we’ll understand Trump’s true motives—and the pressures on his decision­making—anytime soon. But the truth, or something more closely approximating it, will come with time. As Strzok writes, “Truth can be devilishly opaque, and can’t always be explained in five minutes, or even in 500 minutes, let alone 280 characters. But I know this: Truth is ultimately knowable and incontrovertible.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Strzok, he won’t be there to keep pressing the investigations forward inside the FBI. It’s not hard to imagine a scenario where, had he and Page used their personal cell phones, Strzok would never have become a national figure and would today be the special agent in charge of a midsize field office, like Minneapolis or Salt Lake City, preparing to rotate back to a top job in headquarters.\r\n\r\nRussia, though, must be happy he’s no longer watching them.\r\n\r\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

                            Content = "BACK IN JUNE, Apple announced a major change to its Macs: Starting in late 2020, its new laptops and desktop computers will move away from Intel and use processors built by Apple using the same ARM architecture it uses on phones and tablets. It’s a seismic shift that won’t happen all at once (especially since Apple just updated the Intel-based iMac), but it leaves consumers with an important choice to make. Should you buy an Intel-based Mac now, or wait for one with Apple’s new custom silicon?\r\n\r\nWhy Apple’s New Processors Matter\r\nLongtime Apple fans will recall that Apple made a similar transition from its PowerPC processors to Intel chips back in 2005. Among the benefits at the time, using the same processor architecture that comparable PCs used meant it was easier for developers to bring popular Windows apps to the Mac (or at least emulate the ones that didn’t get direct ports), ushering in a thriving era of compatibility and development for Mac users.\r\n\r\nToday, Macs are much more common, and it’s not as difficult to convince big developers to make apps for Apple’s platforms (some will even fight in court for the privilege). But Apple’s other devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, use Apple’s own custom processors. As such, they live in their own separate world. Developers making apps for both Macs and iPhones would have to do extra work to make their apps available on both platforms. With the switch to Apple’s own processors, it will be possible to write an app once and run it on most Apple devices with minimal modification.\r\n\r\nThere’s also a possibility that Apple’s new processors will be faster than Intel processors would be, but that’s still a bit of an open question. The company has suggested that the processors in its iPhones and iPads are so efficient that when translated to larger devices, it will give Macs a leg up on the competition. However, it hasn’t cited any benchmarks for laptop or workstation usage yet, and over the short term, it’s possible that apps automatically converted to work on the new processors will take performance hits that eat through any gains (more on that later). However, over the long term, Apple-made processors could offer better performance and make developing for all Apple products simpler.\r\n\r\nWill My Intel Mac Be Obsolete Next Year?\r\nIf you need to buy a Mac right now, and all that’s available is an Intel-based Mac, you might reasonably wonder if it’s going to be out of date soon. That isn’t likely to be the case. (At least, no more than every computer is out of date the minute you buy it.) Apple says it will support Intel Macs for years, and there are even some Intel-based Macs that haven’t been released yet.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase AppleCare+ with your Mac, then you’re promised at least three years worth of support from the time you buy it, which means that even if you buy one of the new Intel-based Macs, you won’t be stranded without support for a while. However, that only applies to accidental repair damage and priority tech support. You can keep using your Mac long after that, often with minimal issues.\r\n\r\nIn general, Macs tend to receive OS updates for many years. Big Sur, the newest version of macOS, will roll out to Macs released as far back as 2013, indicating that even seven-year-old Macs are still getting the latest software. Furthermore, Apple provides service and parts for Macs for up to five years after they’ve stopped being sold. In other words, even if you bought a new Intel-based Mac today, it would likely still receive OS updates, qualify for service, and have spare parts available in 2026.\r\nIt won’t be the hottest hot rod on the block anymore, but you won’t be on your third new Mac by then, either.\r\n\r\nDo I Need to Buy An Intel Mac to Keep All My Old Apps?\r\nIf you’re worried that buying a new ARM-based Mac will mean none of your old apps are supported, it’s an understandable concern, but you should be fine. There’s a reason Apple isn’t switching immediately to its own processors and cutting off Intel support all at once. Beside the fact that older Macs will still be in use for years to come, developers will need to update their existing apps to work on the new processors. Fortunately, Apple seems more prepared this time around than when they switched to Intel, but the very first Macs using ARM-based processors might still be waiting for some of the benefits.\r\n\r\nWhile Apple has many major developers on board—Adobe and Microsoft are already porting over their Creative Cloud and Office suites respectively—smaller developers will need to update their apps. Apple claims that “the vast majority of developers can get their apps up and running in a matter of days.” In the event that the one little app you depend on from a developer who made it as a side project doesn’t get updated immediately, Apple is also relying on Rosetta 2 to emulate those older apps and keep them running. This is similar to the Rosetta tool the company used when transitioning to Intel.\r\n\r\nAll of that means that, in theory, upgrading from an Intel to an ARM-based Mac should be relatively seamless and won’t leave any apps behind. It’s still possible for there to be extra bugs, and perhaps some apps won’t run quite as well as they used to right away, but it’s unlikely you’ll upgrade and find crucial apps missing. So if you were planning to buy an Intel Mac after newer Macs are available, just to maintain backwards compatibility, you probably won’t need to.\r\n\r\nOf course, it’s still a good idea to wait for reviews of the specific hardware to come out before making any buying decisions. But there’s no dramatic compatibility cliff coming that you’ll have to jump off of once ARM-based Macs arrive. If anything, it might be a compatibility speed bump.\r\n\r\nGet What You Need and Don’t Worry Too Much About the Rest\r\nMajor transitions like this can cause some buyer’s anxiety, and everything we’ve discussed so far is, admittedly, a little bit based on speculation. It’s not impossible that Apple will come out tomorrow and say that all Intel-based Macs will be dead by 2021, but given the company’s track record and explicit promises, it’s unlikely.\r\n\r\nWhich means that whether you buy an Intel Mac is up to what you prefer. Would you rather have access to the latest tech, with iPad apps on your Mac as soon as possible? Then wait a bit for the new ARM-based Macs. Do you need a new computer but without too much disruption to your existing routine? You can get an Intel-based Mac without too much worry that it’s going to be obsolete any time soon.\r\n\r\nNo matter which direction you choose, you’re probably fine.",

                            Content = "THE PANDEMIC MIGHT have thrown a wrench in Google's plans to show off all things new with Android this year, but it hasn't stopped the company from launching the latest version of its mobile operating system.\r\n\r\nAndroid is the OS that runs on a variety of devices from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Motorola, Sony, and even Google. The new version is called Android 11. (Google switched from fun dessert-themed names to boring numbers last year.) The new Android doesn't introduce any dramatic changes to the platform, but when you update, you'll notice a few interface tweaks and a handful of new features offering meaningful everyday improvements. Before we get to the new features, let's talk about how to get the update.\r\n\r\nHow to Download Android 11\r\nAndroid software updates are notoriously slow to roll out, meaning only a few phones will be able to download Android 11 today. Manufacturers like Samsung will take months to send it out to their own devices. And if you bought your phone directly from your wireless carrier, you'll have to wait even longer as the update requires an extra level of approval.\r\n\r\nIf you have a Google Pixel 2 or newer, you can get Android 11 now. Select OnePlus, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Realme phones can also get it, not to mention Android One devices, like most of the Nokia-branded phones from HMD Global (though Nokia owners might still need to wait a few weeks). Before downloading any software update, make sure you back up your phone. Your settings menu might look different based on your device, but you should be able to find the option in Settings > System > Backup > Back up now.\r\n\r\nTo check if you can download the update, head into Settings > System and then tap on Advanced > System Update. It should automatically start searching for the update (or you can tap Check for update). If you don't see anything, you may have to wait a few days. Even on the phones that get it first, Google often sends Android updates out over the course of several days.\r\n\r\nIf your phone isn't a Google Pixel or an Android One phone, check your manufacturer's website or social media (or the web in general) to see when or if your phone will get Android 11. Most high-end phones get two years of Android upgrades from the date of their launch, so if you bought your phone in late 2018 or sooner, then you should get it.\r\n\r\nTop New Features\r\nWe've been using a near-final build of Android 11 for the past few days and collected 11 of our favorite features—yes, our list goes to 11! This is just a slice of what's new; there are more than 100 features that cater to app developers to further improve the overall Android experience. You can read about all of them on Google's developer site.\r\n\r\n1. A New Power Menu\r\n\r\nThe biggest visual change is what happens when you open the power menu (a long-press of the power button on most phones). You used to just see the options to restart the phone, lock it, or turn it off, but now you get quick access to your default Google Pay credit or debit card (you can change the default in the Google Pay app) if you've set it up. Boarding passes and other tickets added through Google Pay can be accessed here as well. Use Samsung Pay instead? You'll presumably be able to access cards the same way if you set it as your phone's default Tap and Pay solution (Settings > Connections > NFC and payment > Tap and pay > Samsung Pay).\r\nBelow the cards, you'll find shortcuts to any smart home controls you've set up through the Google Home app. These quick access tiles let you toggle the power switch on lights, TVs, vacuums, and any other smart home device with just a tap, saving you the step of using your voice or opening up the Google Home app. You can customize these controls from the power menu itself (tap the triple dots on the right).\r\n\r\n2. A Redesigned Media Player\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you play music, you usually see a notification with music controls when you swipe down the notification drawer, right? In Android 11, these controls are now integrated into the quick settings menu itself. Swipe down from the top of the screen and alongside your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tiles, you'll see music controls (if you have music playing). It's a cleaner look, and it also works with streaming video (like YouTube clips) you've cast to other screens.\r\n\r\nIt's not just a cosmetic improvement. You can also choose what device is playing the music, which is handy if you have Bluetooth speakers or earbuds connected in your home. Drag the menu down further to see more options, like the ability to give a song a thumbs up without needing to open your music app.\r\n\r\n3. Bubbles!\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember chat heads? Facebook Messenger has long-used chat heads that float everywhere, even in other apps, as a way to quickly access DM conversations. Google is taking that idea, calling it Bubbles, and expanding it natively to other messaging apps. To turn it on, head to Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications > Bubbles and toggle it on. You'll now see your messages appear as floating bubbles, though not all messaging apps work (Instagram Directs and Twitter Direct Messages can't be bubblefied, for example). You can move these bubbles around; dragging them to the bottom of the screen gets rid of them.\r\n\r\nOn the notification itself, you'll see a tiny arrow and circle icon on the bottom right. When the arrow points at the bubble, tapping it will open up the conversation as a bubble. If the arrow is facing away from the bubble, tapping it will open your message in the messaging app. These bubbles are grouped together with various messaging apps, so a Telegram bubble can be grouped with a Facebook Messenger bubble, and you can even set specific conversations as bubbles too. It makes it dead simple to continue conversations anywhere.\r\n\r\n4. Even Better Notifications\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle is always tweaking how notifications appear in Android. Notifications are now grouped, so messaging apps fall under a new \"Conversations\" header (which also shows longer message threads). You can further customize your notifications by putting them into three categories: Silent, Default, and Priority.\r\n\r\nThe former will put notifications under a \"Silent\" header and you won't be alerted about them. On Default, your phone will ring or vibrate when a notification comes in if it's not on mute. Priority notifications are only available for select apps, like messaging apps, and they will show up at the very top of the notification drawer and allows apps to appear as a floating bubble. These also can interrupt you in Do Not Disturb mode, but you'll need to enable this first by heading into your DND settings.\r\n\r\nPress and hold a notification to choose a category. There's a lot to play around with here if you want to exert more control over your notifications. Not everything needs to ping you, like Facebook birthday reminders.\r\n\r\n5. Natively Record Your Screen\r\n\r\nWhether you want to show off your gaming skills or you just want to send Wi-Fi instructions to grandpa, Android 11 finally lets you record the screen without requiring a third-party app. Just swipe down the notification shade and find the Screen Record quick settings tile (you might have to swipe to the left to see it). If you can't find it, you need to add the tile first by tapping the pencil icon and dragging the tile to the top.\r\n\r\nTap the tile to start recording the screen. You can choose to record audio via the microphone or device audio and if you want to see touches on the screen. You'll see a three-second timer in the status bar, and then it will turn into a red dot to indicate recording has started. Just swipe the notification drawer down and tap the Screen Record notification to stop. You can tap to view it, and then share, edit, or delete it immediately.\r\n\r\n6. More Restrictive Permissions\r\n\r\n\r\nNew apps you install ask you for permission to access certain components of the phone, like the microphone, camera, GPS, and other sensors. Most of the time this is necessary for features to work. A video messaging app you install will need access to the camera and microphone so you can make video calls. But there are apps that have abused these permissions to collect more data about you.\r\n\r\nIn Android 11, you get the option to force an app to ask for permission every single time it wants to use a component on your phone. That sits alongside the existing option to allow access only when you are using the app. Even better, apps you don't use but are still installed on your phone can automatically see their permissions revoked over time (\"a few months\" according to Google). You need to opt into this though. Press and hold the app icon, tap App Info (the i symbol), and tap Permissions. At the very bottom, you'll see a toggle to Remove permissions if app isn't used.\r\n\r\n7. Keep Your Notification History\r\nEver impulsively swipe a notification away before getting a chance to read it? Now you don't have to wonder if it was something important. Android 11 introduces Notification History, which you can access by going to Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications > Notification history. Toggle it on and you'll see notifications that were recently dismissed and alerts from each app that pinged you in the last 24 hours. You can tap on these to jump straight into the respective app, just like a normal notification.\r\n\r\n8. Pin Apps in the Share Menu\r\nIf you've always struggled to find the app you want to use to share something in Android's Share Menu, you'll be happy to learn you can finally pin your favorite apps to the top. Unfortunately, Google has several different share menus. For example, the sharing in Google Maps looks different from sharing in Google Photos, and that looks different from sharing in YouTube, which is also not the same as the primary Android share menu. Yikes. If you manage to access the main share menu, tap on an app in the Apps List and you can pin whatever you'd like to the top.\r\n\r\n9. Improved Voice Access for Accessibility\r\nVoice Access is an accessibility app Google introduced several years ago that allows people to control phones with just their voice. Previously, it required you to memorize a few commands or choose corresponding numbers on the screen. Android 11 is even better at understanding the content on the screen and the context around it. Just say the name of the app you want to open or the action you want to complete, and the phone will understand—or at least, more often than it used to. In order to use Voice Access, make sure you have the app installed first.\r\n\r\n10. More App Suggestions\r\nAndroid already makes smart suggestions for apps you might want to open next. Based on the context of your current workflow, or even your location and surroundings, it shows a selection of relevant apps in the top row of the app drawer. Android 11 now lets you add a dedicated \"suggested apps\" dock on the home screen. It basically bumps your existing dock up a row. The new dock that appears beneath the existing one will be populated with an ever-changing collection of apps Android expects you'll want to open next.\r\n\r\nIf you're very particular about where apps should appear on your home screen, then this is not the feature for you. You can toggle it on or off by pressing on the home screen, going to Home settings > Suggestions > Suggestions on Home screen. But you can mix and match things by pinning a couple of preferred apps in this new dock and leaving the empty slots for the revolving suggestions.\r\n\r\n11. Odds and Ends\r\nA few other smaller improvements include a more granular Do Not Disturb mode. We touched on this earlier, but you can now set select conversations from specific messaging apps to come through even if you have the mode turned on. This also applies to all the apps you have installed—you can pick and choose what apps can break through when DND is turned on.\r\n\r\nIf you're playing music through Bluetooth earbuds and you turn on Airplane mode, Android 11 won't turn off Bluetooth but will continue to turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data. That's handy when we all start going back to airports.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the previous screen in Android requires a swipe in from the left or right edge. You can customize the sensitivity of this before, but Android 11 goes a small step further by letting you tweak the sensitivity on the left and right side each. Hopefully, it means fewer accidental back swipes.\r\n\r\nThere are 117 new emoji! That includes 55 new skin tones and lots of refreshed designs, but we're particularly fond of the new bison.",
